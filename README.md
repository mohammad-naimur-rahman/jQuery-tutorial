## jQuery Essensials

Though it is 2022 and to build dynamic and modern applicaitons, developers don't use jQuery anymore. But for some reason, I am learning jQuery. This repository will be a place to look for jQuery tutorials whenever I need it.

##### Some of the reasons for learning jQuery in 2022

- As I am a frontend developer, I learn desigs, animations etc. from someone else's works and they use jQuery sometimes. But as I don't know jQuery, I don't understand their code too. If I can understand jQuery, then I will be able to implement that desigs or animations in my React applicaitons also in my way.
- I may have clients who need to fix their websites those are old and used jQuery. Then I will be able to help them out.
- Learning new things always excites me. Learning jQuery will also be exciting and interesting to me.

I am learning jQuery from here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgvIox6ehkM
But in future, I may learn more about jQuery from other sources.

Feel free to use the tutorials for use personal usage and also you can contribute to the tutorials and also to the documentation. You are welcome..
